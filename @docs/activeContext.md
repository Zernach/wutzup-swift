# Active Context: Wutzup

## Current State
**Status**: 🚀 **iOS Swift Project COMPLETE** ✅  
**Date**: October 21, 2025  
**Phase**: Phase 1 (iOS Setup) 100% Complete → Ready for Xcode Project Creation

**Latest Update**: ✅ **Navigation Update Bug Fixed** (October 21, 2025)

**NavigationRequestObserver Multiple Updates Fix:**
- Fixed "tried to update multiple times per frame" error
- Added `Task.yield()` in AppState auth state observation
- Wrapped navigation path changes in async Task with yield
- Prevents multiple state updates in same rendering frame
- See `@docs/NAVIGATION_UPDATE_FIX.md` for complete details

**Previously Fixed**: ✅ **Race Conditions Fixed** (October 21, 2025)

**Chat Loading Race Condition:**
- Fixed race condition where chats sometimes didn't load on login
- Conversations now load immediately when auth succeeds (in AppState)
- No longer dependent on view lifecycle timing
- See `@docs/CHAT_LOADING_RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md` for details

**FCM Token Registration Race Condition:**
- Fixed race condition where FCM token failed to save before auth was ready
- Token now stores as pending and saves when auth succeeds
- Push notifications guaranteed to work after login
- See `@docs/FCM_TOKEN_RACE_CONDITION_FIX.md` for details

## 🔥 BREAKING CHANGE: Firebase Architecture

### What Just Changed
**Switched from custom backend to Firebase!** This is a game-changer that cuts development time in half.

**Old Architecture:**
- Custom Node.js/Express backend
- PostgreSQL database
- Custom WebSocket server
- Manual authentication system
- Custom push notification server
- AWS S3 for storage
- **Estimated time: 8-10 weeks**

**New Architecture (Firebase):**
- Firebase Firestore (real-time database)
- Firebase Auth (authentication)
- Firebase Cloud Functions (serverless)
- Firebase Cloud Messaging (push notifications)
- Firebase Storage (file storage)
- **Estimated time: 4-6 weeks** ⚡

### Why This is Better
1. **~95% Less Backend Code** - Focus on iOS app instead
2. **Real-Time Built-In** - No WebSocket code needed
3. **Offline Support Automatic** - Firestore handles queue/sync
4. **Auth Included** - No custom login system
5. **Push Integrated** - FCM manages everything
6. **Auto-Scaling** - Google infrastructure
7. **Faster MVP** - Ship in 4-6 weeks vs 8-10 weeks

## Active Decisions

### Decisions Made ✅
1. **Backend: Firebase** (vs custom Node.js/Express)
   - Reason: 95% less code, faster MVP, built-in features
   
2. **Database: Firestore** (vs PostgreSQL)
   - Reason: Real-time by default, offline support, NoSQL flexibility
   
3. **Local Storage: SwiftData** (vs Core Data)
   - Reason: Modern Swift-first API, less boilerplate, iOS 16+
   
4. **Real-Time: Firestore Listeners** (vs WebSocket)
   - Reason: Built-in, no server code, auto-reconnection
   
5. **Auth: Firebase Auth** (vs custom)
   - Reason: Complete solution, no code to write
   
6. **Push: FCM** (vs direct APNs)
   - Reason: Integrated with Firebase, simpler setup

7. **iOS Minimum: iOS 16+** (vs iOS 15+)
   - Reason: Required for SwiftData, acceptable trade-off

### Decisions Pending
1. ⏳ **Firebase Plan**: Spark (free) vs Blaze (paid)
   - Spark: Good for MVP and testing
   - Blaze: Needed for Cloud Functions in production
   - **Decision**: Start with Spark, upgrade when deploying
   
2. ⏳ **Email Verification**: Required or optional?
   - Consideration: Security vs user friction
   - **Recommendation**: Optional for MVP, required later
   
3. ⏳ **Image Compression**: Client-side or Cloud Functions?
   - Client-side: Faster, no server cost
   - Cloud Functions: Better quality, thumbnails
   - **Recommendation**: Client-side for MVP

---

## Known Constraints

### Technical
- **iOS 16.0+ minimum** (required for SwiftData) - excludes ~40% of devices
- **Firestore limits**: 1 write/second per document (fine for messaging)
- **Firebase costs**: Free tier sufficient for < 100 daily active users
- **Cloud Functions**: Need Blaze plan for production
- **Vendor lock-in**: Tied to Firebase/Google (acceptable for MVP)

### Timeline
- Target: **4-6 weeks for MVP** (down from 8-10 weeks!)
- Critical path: Setup (2-3 days) → Auth (2 days) → Messaging (1 week) → Testing (1 week)
- Buffer: 1 week for unexpected issues

### Resources
- Developer availability: [To be determined]
- Budget: Firebase free tier (Spark) initially, then ~$25-50/month (Blaze)
- Testing devices: Need 2+ iOS devices (iOS 16+)
- Google account: Required for Firebase

---

## Current Blockers
**None** - Firebase backend deployed, database operational, ready for iOS development!

---

## Recent Learnings

### Firebase Deployment (Latest!)
1. **Python virtual environments** must be properly configured for Cloud Functions
2. **Single-field indexes** are automatic in Firestore - only define composite indexes
3. **Blaze plan required** for Cloud Functions deployment (production)
4. **Firebase CLI** handles all deployment seamlessly with `firebase deploy`
5. **Cloud Functions 2nd Gen** automatically created (Python 3.13 support)
6. **All APIs auto-enabled** by Firebase CLI (Cloud Build, Artifact Registry, etc.)

### Firebase Benefits
1. Firestore offline persistence is automatic - no manual queue needed
2. Real-time listeners eliminate all WebSocket complexity
3. Firebase Auth removes entire auth system (weeks of work)
4. Security rules are declarative and testable
5. Cloud Functions handle server-side logic without managing servers
6. SwiftData is much simpler than Core Data
7. Firebase emulator enables fast local development

### Trade-offs (Accepted)
1. Vendor lock-in to Firebase (can migrate later if needed)
2. iOS 16+ only (acceptable for new app in 2025)
3. Less control over backend (but not needed for MVP)
4. Firestore NoSQL vs SQL (different patterns, but simpler)
5. Costs can scale up (but predictable and manageable)

---

## Questions to Resolve
1. ~~What backend technology to use?~~ **✅ SOLVED: Firebase**
2. Do we have a Google account for Firebase? (yes, free to create)
3. What's the budget for Firebase? (free tier OK for MVP)
4. How many developers? (Firebase means we don't need backend developer!)
5. Any specific design preferences? (standard iOS patterns recommended)

---

## Risk Watch

### High Priority Risks (Updated)
1. **Firestore Security Rules**
   - Risk: Misconfigured rules allow unauthorized access
   - Mitigation: Test rules thoroughly, use emulator, review before production
   
2. **Firebase Costs**
   - Risk: Unexpected usage spikes → high bills
   - Mitigation: Set budget alerts, monitor dashboard, optimize queries

3. **iOS 16+ Only**
   - Risk: Excludes ~40% of iOS devices
   - Mitigation: Acceptable for new app, user base will update over time

### Medium Priority Risks
1. **SwiftData Maturity**
   - Risk: Newer technology, fewer resources/examples
   - Mitigation: Fall back to Core Data if major issues (unlikely)

2. **Vendor Lock-In**
   - Risk: Hard to migrate away from Firebase later
   - Mitigation: Abstract Firebase calls behind service protocols

### Low Risk (Firebase Solved These!)
- ~~Real-time reliability~~ - Firestore handles this
- ~~State synchronization~~ - Firestore listeners keep state in sync
- ~~Backend scaling~~ - Google infrastructure auto-scales
- ~~Message queue~~ - Firestore offline persistence handles this

## Notes for Future Me

### Important Reminders
- Start with Firebase emulator (free, fast iteration)
- Write Firestore security rules early (don't rely on test mode)
- Enable Firestore offline persistence from day one
- Test on real devices (iOS 16+), not just simulator
- Monitor Firebase usage dashboard regularly
- SwiftData @Query is powerful - use it for reactive UI
- Firebase listeners auto-update - trust the system

### Firebase-Specific Checklist
- [ ] Enable Firestore offline persistence
- [ ] Write comprehensive security rules
- [ ] Test security rules with emulator
- [ ] Create indexes for common queries
- [ ] Setup Cloud Functions for push notifications
- [ ] Configure Firebase app check (anti-abuse)
- [ ] Set Firebase budget alerts
- [ ] Use Firestore batched writes where possible

### Code Review Checklist (Firebase Edition)
- [ ] All Firestore writes have error handling
- [ ] Security rules tested for all user types
- [ ] Listeners properly removed on view disappear
- [ ] Firestore queries use indexes (no warnings)
- [ ] Images compressed before uploading to Storage
- [ ] SwiftData models have unique identifiers
- [ ] No infinite listener loops
- [ ] Pagination implemented for large collections

### Testing Priorities (Same as Before)
1. Message send/receive reliability (most critical)
2. Offline → online transitions (Firestore handles this!)
3. App lifecycle (background/foreground)
4. Force quit recovery
5. Poor network conditions
6. Rapid-fire messaging
7. Group chat functionality
