## Testing Scenarios

### Critical Test Cases
The app must successfully handle these scenarios:

1. **Real-Time Chat**
   - Two devices chatting simultaneously
   - Messages appear instantly on both devices
   - Typing indicators work correctly

2. **Offline/Online Transitions**
   - One device goes offline
   - Messages sent to offline device queue on server
   - Offline device comes back online
   - All queued messages delivered successfully
   - Read receipts update properly

3. **Background/Foreground**
   - Messages sent while app is backgrounded
   - Notifications appear correctly
   - Open app to see messages immediately
   - No duplicate messages

4. **Force Quit Recovery**
   - App force-quit mid-conversation
   - Reopen app
   - All message history present
   - Pending messages complete sending
   - Conversation state restored

5. **Poor Network Conditions**
   - Test on 3G speeds
   - Simulate packet loss
   - Enable/disable airplane mode repeatedly
   - Throttle connection speed
   - Verify all messages eventually deliver

6. **Rapid-Fire Messaging**
   - Send 20+ messages in quick succession
   - All messages appear in correct order
   - No message loss
   - UI remains responsive
   - Message states update correctly

7. **Group Chat Functionality**
   - Create group with 3+ participants
   - All members receive messages
   - Message attribution works
   - Typing indicators for multiple users
   - Read receipts track all members

- Follow Apple Human Interface Guidelines

### Backend
- RESTful API and/or WebSocket connections
- Backend technology TBD (Node.js, Python, Go, etc.)
- Cloud hosting (AWS, Firebase, custom server)

---

## Timeline Considerations

### Phase 1: Core Messaging (Weeks 1-3)

- Offline queue/sync
- Optimistic updates

### Phase 3: Enhancement (Weeks 6-7)
- Group chat
- Read receipts
- Typing indicators
- Push notifications

- All test scenarios
- Bug fixes
- Performance optimization
- UI polish

---

## Dependencies

### Client-Side (iOS)
- WebSocket library (Starscream or Socket.IO)
- Local database (Core Data or Realm)
- Image handling/caching (Kingfisher or SDWebImage)
- Push notification setup (APNs)

### Backend
- WebSocket server
- REST API
- Database (PostgreSQL, MongoDB, etc.)
- Push notification service
- File storage for images

---

## Risk Assessment

### High Risk
- **Real-time reliability**: Network issues causing message loss
- **State synchronization**: Keeping client/server state aligned
- **Performance at scale**: Handling large message histories

### Medium Risk
- **Push notifications**: APNs setup and testing
- **Group chat complexity**: Message delivery to multiple recipients
- **Offline queue**: Managing pending message queue

### Low Risk
- **Basic UI**: Standard iOS patterns well-documented
- **Image handling**: Mature libraries available
- **Authentication**: Standard patterns established
