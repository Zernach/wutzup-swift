# Product Context: Wutzup

## Why This Exists
Wutzup addresses the need for a reliable, real-time messaging solution that works seamlessly across all network conditions. Many messaging apps fail when users have poor connectivity or go offline temporarily. Wutzup ensures users never lose messages and always have access to their conversation history.

## Problems It Solves

### 1. Message Reliability
**Problem**: Users lose messages when their connection drops or app crashes mid-send.  
**Solution**: Offline-first architecture with local persistence and message queue ensures zero message loss.

### 2. Network Resilience
**Problem**: Apps become unusable on slow or unstable connections (3G, spotty WiFi).  
**Solution**: Optimistic updates show messages instantly; background sync handles delivery when connectivity returns.

### 3. Real-Time Communication
**Problem**: Message delays break the flow of conversation.  
**Solution**: WebSocket connections enable sub-second delivery with live presence and typing indicators.

### 4. Conversation Context
**Problem**: Users can't see who's online or when messages were read.  
**Solution**: Online/offline status, typing indicators, and read receipts provide full conversation awareness.

### 5. Group Communication
**Problem**: Coordinating with multiple people requires separate one-on-one chats.  
**Solution**: Group chat functionality allows 3+ users to communicate in a single conversation.

## How It Works

### User Journey: Sending a Message

1. **User opens app** → sees list of recent conversations
2. **Taps on conversation** → chat interface loads with message history
3. **Types message** → sees "other user is typing..." indicator
4. **Taps Send** → message appears instantly in their chat with "sending" indicator
5. **Backend confirms** → indicator changes to "sent" (✓)
6. **Recipient receives** → indicator changes to "delivered" (✓✓)
7. **Recipient reads** → indicator changes to "read" (blue ✓✓)

### User Journey: Offline Scenario

1. **User loses connection** → "Offline" banner appears
2. **User sends messages** → messages appear locally with "pending" status
3. **Messages queue locally** → Core Data stores unsent messages
4. **Connection restores** → "Syncing..." indicator shows
5. **Queue processes** → all messages send in order
6. **Status updates** → each message transitions to "sent"

### User Journey: Group Chat

1. **User creates group** → selects 2+ contacts, sets group name
2. **Group created** → all members see new group in chat list
3. **User sends message** → message shows sender's name
4. **All members receive** → real-time delivery via WebSocket
5. **Read receipts** → shows how many/who read the message
