# Assets Directory

This directory should contain:

- `icon.png` - App icon (1024x1024 recommended)
- `favicon.png` - Website favicon (32x32 or 48x48 recommended)

For now, these are optional. The site will work without them, but you may see warnings during the build process.

To add proper icons:
1. Create or export your icons at the recommended sizes
2. Place them in this directory
3. The build process will automatically pick them up
